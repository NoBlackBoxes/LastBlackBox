# Electrons: NB3: Measuring Current

## Concepts
- Current is the trickiest of the basic electronic values to measure
- The current must flow *through* the meter. Therefore, you must measure in series.
- **Warning**: Do ***NOT*** try to measure the current coming out of your batteries directly...it will blow your fuse.
