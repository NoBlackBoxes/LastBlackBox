# Atoms: Atomic Structure

## Concepts
- Row/Period 1: 1s (2): Hydrogen and Helium
- Row/Period 2: 2s + 2p (2 + 6 = 8)
- Row/Period 3: 8 - Na + Cl (also metals)
- Row/Period 4: 18 - Metals!
- Unstable/Radioactive Nuclei
- Filling Order: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p

## Connections
- Iron is (by Mass) the most common element on Earth
- Iron is the last element produced in a star
