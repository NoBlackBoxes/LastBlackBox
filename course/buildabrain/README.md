## NB3

You will be building a brain for your robot. The robot's physical layout mimics the basic anatomy of a (vertebrate) brain. As you progress through the course, your robot will *evolve* into an increasingly sophisticated machine. The goal is to create an "intelligent" machine without using any "black boxes". We thus call this robot the No-Black-Box-Brain or NBBB or ***NB3***.
