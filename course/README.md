## NB3

You will be building a brain for your robot. The robot's physical layout mimics the basic anatomy of a (vertebrate) brain. As you progress through the course, your robot will *evolve* into an increasingly sophisticated machine. The goal is to create an "intelligent" machine without using any **black boxes**. We thus call this robot the No-Black-Box-Brain or NBBB or ***NB3***.

## Repository
The course is based on the documentation and code in this repo (LBB). Many of the course exercises assume that you have "cloned" this repo to your Host computer. In much of the example code, there is an additional assumption that the LBB repo is in a folder called "NoBlackBoxes" in your home/user directory. You can setup everything (on Linux...and your NB3) with the following commands.

```bash
# ...from your "home" directory
mkdir NoBlackBoxes  # Create NoBlackBoxes directory
cd NoBlackBoxes     # Change to NoBlackBoxes directory

# Clone LBB repo (only the most recent commit)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/NoBlackBoxes/LastBlackBox
```

## Versions
There are shorter versions of this course that cover a specific subset of the "black boxes" and focus on specific themes.

- [Bootcamp](versions/bootcamp/README.md): A one-week intensive introduction to the essentials of modern technology and neuroscience.

- [Build a Brain](versions/buildabrain/README.md): Designed for secondary school age students, this hands-on course shows you how recent advances in science and technology have made it possible for humans to create intelligent machines...by building you own. 

- [Own Phone](versions/ownphone/README.md): ***-Under Development-*** Get your "smartphone license"! Demonstrate to your parents/friends that you can take control of your digital tools...before they take control you.
