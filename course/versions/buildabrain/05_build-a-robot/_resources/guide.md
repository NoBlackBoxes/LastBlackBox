# Teaching Guide

## Topics
- Robotics: "Braitenberg Vehicles" and sensorimotor loops
- Servo motors (controlling hobby servos with digital pulses)
- Microcontoller programming ("servo" library)

## Goal
Build a Braitenberg Vehicle
- Attach servo motors and wheels to the NB3
  - Test the servos
- Attach a ball caster (third wheel) to the NB3
- Measure values from a light sensor and use these values to adjust the speed of the servo motors

## Tools
- Light sources (e.g. phone torch) to guide the robots
