# Build a Brain : Build a Robot
We will now complete the first version of your NB3!

## Control
Getting a motor to move precisely how you want it to (direction and speed) is very important for *controlling* the behaviour of your robot. A number of very clever strategies have been developed to help you take **control** of your motor.

#### Watch this video: [PWM](https://vimeo.com/1033905955)
> We can control a "continuous" range of outputs with a binary digital signal (only 0s and 1s) by switching the output **ON** and **OFF** very quickly. Our "continuous" output is then the average of the percentage of time spent **ON** vs **OFF**. We cal this percentage the "duty cycle", and we call this output control method *pulse width modulation* or **PWM**.


#### Watch this video: [Servo Loops](https://vimeo.com/1033963709)
> A servo loop connects feedback from a sensor to the control signals sent to a motor.


## Robotics
Combining sensors, motors, and a "brain" in between.

#### Watch this video: [NB3 : Muscles (Servos)](Servos))
> Let's build your robot's movement system (using servo motors).

**TASK**: Mount the servo motors and wheels to your NB3.

:-:-: The mounted servo motors should look like this.

#### Watch this video: [NB3 : Ball Caster](https://vimeo.com/1034797327)
> Let's add a front wheel (ball caster) to keep your NB3 from dragging its face on the ground.

**TASK**: Mount caster (ball bearing) to the front of your NB3.
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
:-:-: The ball caster mount should look like this.

# Project
### NB3 : Build a Braitenberg Vehicle
> Here we create the first Braitenberg Vehicle, a simple sensory-motor feedback loop connecting two light sensors to the motion of two wheels.

**TASK**: Measure two light sensors and *decide* how to activate the direction of your two wheels in response.
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
:-:-: You should have created a robot that wither likes (turns toward) or avoids (turns away from) light.
