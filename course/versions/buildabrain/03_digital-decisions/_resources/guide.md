# Teaching Guide

## Goal
Build a light-sensitive motor.
- Build a MOSFET motor driver (find the threshold voltage)
- Add a light sensing circuit as the gate input

## Tools
- Motor attachments (tape is fine, mini-props?)

## Steps
> lecture - **practical** - *optional*

- (05:005) Why is amplification so useful? Where do we find amplifiers? How do they work?
- (05:010) Semiconductors (Silicon, doping, P-type and N-type) - expensive way to create a conductor, why bother?
- (05:015) NPN sandwich. The holes meet the electrons at the boundary...no current can flow - very expensive way to make an insulator, why bother? 
- (05:020) Use an external voltage (field) to create a channel from N to N (source to drain) - hmmm...interesting
- (05:025) A small external field affects the flow of a large number of electrons, it amplifies...this is a FET (field effect transistor) - MOSFET
- (05:030) The significance of MOSFETs - the item of tech that humans have made more of than any other...*by far*
