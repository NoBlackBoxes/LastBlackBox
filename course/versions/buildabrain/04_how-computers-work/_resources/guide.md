# Teaching Guide

## Topics
- Logic Gate (NOT, AND, OR, etc.)
- Memory (flash/floating-gate transistor)
- Computer architecture
- Microcontroller
- Programming (C-style)
- Compiler

## Goal
Program a microcontroller (Arduino).
- Connect to the Arduino and upload a program
- Change the "Blink" example to blink faster/slower
- Make a buzzer buzz
- Measure a light sensor (wth an ADC)
- Make the buzzer's frequency change when the light intenity changes

## Tools
- Example silicon wafer

## Steps
> lecture - **practical** - *optional*

- (05:005) Transistors as switches...ON/OFF...True/False...0/1
- (05:010) Binary numbers (data)
- (05:015) Logic: What can we do to this data? Logic gates (AND, OR...XOR).
- (05:020) Memory: How can we store this data? Floating fate transistor...requires quantum mechanics.
- (05:025) Lots of Logic and Lots of memory ~ computer (show silicon wafer)...rough diagram of computer architecture. Memory holds data and "ops"...logic operations selected by a list of commands stored in memory...a program.
- (05:030) Microcontroller (Arduino)...a small computer, easy to program...with 100ks of transistors (picture of Arduinio die)
- (05:035) Arduino IDE, we need a software tool to convert programs we can read and write into binary programs that the Arduino understands (this is a compiler).
- (15:050) **Connect your Arduino, open the Arduino IDE, compile (verify) and upload the blink example.**
- (10:060) *break*
- (90:150) **Complete the Arduino programming tasks**
