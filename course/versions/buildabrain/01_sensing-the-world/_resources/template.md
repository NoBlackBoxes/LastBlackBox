# Build a Brain : Sensing the World
We will start by learning how electricity is used to create "sensors", which will be the inputs for your robot brain. Sensors will measure anything you want your robot to know about the world (light intensity, temperature, pressure, sound, etc.).

### Build a Light Sensor
Build a voltage divider with one of the fixed resistors replaced with an LDR (light-dependent resistor). Does the "output" voltage vary with light level? What should the value of the fixed resistor be to maximize the sensitive range of the output voltage for varying light levels?
