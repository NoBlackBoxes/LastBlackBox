# Teaching Guide

## Goal
Build a light sensing circuit that change's the output voltage in response to changes in light.
- Assemble the NB3's body (prototyping base)
- Learn how to use a multimeter to measure voltage and resistance (maybe current)
- Learn how a solderless breadboard works
- Learn to read and draw circuit diagrams (schematics)
- Build simple circuits (voltage divider) and measure
- Use an LDR to build a light sensor

## Tools
- Balloons (voltage)
- Periodic Table (conductors)
