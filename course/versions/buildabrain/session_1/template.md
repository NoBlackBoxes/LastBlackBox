# Build a Brain : Sensing the world
We will start by learning how electricity is used to create "sensors", which will be the inputs for your robot brain. Sensors will measure anything you want your robot to know about the world (light intensity, temperature, pressure, sound, etc.).

## Electrons{01}
Electrons are the sub-atomic particles that underlie *electricity*. Controlling the movement of electrons (and the effects of their movement) will allow us to build many different kinds of electronic devices, from simple circuits to robots and computers.

## Sensors{01}
Your robot's brain is based on digital computers, which can *only* measure electrical signals. Sensors are necessary to convert (transduce) physical signals (light intensity, heat, air pressure, etc.) into electrical signals.

> A light sensor converts a change light intensity into a change in an electrical signal (voltage, current, or resistance).

# Project
### Build a Light Sensor
Build a voltage divider with one of the fixed resistors replaced with an LDR (light-dependent resistor). Does the "output" voltage vary with light level? What should the value of the fixed resistor be to maximize the sensitive range of the output voltage for varying light levels?
- *Help*: A guide to completing this task (and all of the morning circuit building tasks) can be found here: [NB3-Building a Light Sensor](https://vimeo.com/??????)
