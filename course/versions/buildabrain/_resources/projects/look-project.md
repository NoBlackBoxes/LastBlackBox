# Build a Brain : Projects : Look
This project will use Python to control how your NB3 responds to detected faces.

## Requirements
- Connect to your NB3 via SSH using VS Code
- Open the "LastBlackBox" folder in VS Code
- Synchronize the local repository with GitHub
```bash
Sync
```
- Close and re-open the VS Code terminal

## Create *your* copy of the example project code
- Navigate to the example project folder
```bash
cd /home/$USER/NoBlackBoxes/LastBlackBox/boxes/intelligence/NPU/look-NB3
```
- Copy the example project Python code to a "my..." version
```bash
cp look.py my_look.py
```

## Edit *your* code version in VS Code
- Navigate in VS Code's Explorer to boxes -> intelligence -> NPU -> look-NB3
- Open the **my_look.py** Python file in the Editor
- Find the code section where you will add your responses to detected faces
```python
???
```

## Run *your* code version
When you are in the same folder as your python code, then you can run the following command.
```bash
python my_look.py
```
However, we have also created a "shortcut" that you can run from anywhere.
```bash
MyLook
```
