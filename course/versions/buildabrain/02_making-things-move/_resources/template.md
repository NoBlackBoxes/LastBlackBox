# Build a Brain : Making Things Move
Something about motors and magnets

## Magnets{01}
{Electromagnetism}

Magnets were known about (and useful) long before we understood electricity. However, the connection between electricity and magnetism is one of the most profound discoveries of science, and it has major implications for your everyday life...and your NB3.

#### Watch this video: [Electromagnetism](https://vimeo.com/1000810115)
> When electrons move they create a magnetic field.

## Motors
Clever arrangements of electromagnets and their control circuits can be used to produce a rotational force. You will use these devices to make your NB3 move!

- [ ] **TASK**: Play with your brushed DC motor. Spin it forwards *and* backwards...
- *Challenge*: What are some ways you could change the *speed* that your motor spins?
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
Switching the direction that current flows through your motor will change the direction it spins.

# Project
### Build a Speaker
Create an electromagnet by coiling some thin wire. Place this coil near a permanent magnet and send current through the coil. It will move. 
- *Help*: A guide to completing this task can be found here: [NB3-Building a Speaker](https://vimeo.com/??????)
