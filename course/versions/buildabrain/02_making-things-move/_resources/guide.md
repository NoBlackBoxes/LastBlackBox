# Teaching Guide

## Topics
- Ferromagnetism
- Electromagnet (principle and coils)
- Audio speaker
- DC Motor (stepper and brushed)

## Goal
Build a speaker using an electromagnet, paper cup, and audio source.
- Play with magnets and compass
- Coil an electromagnet
- Assemble and test an audio speaker
- Spin a brushed DC motor (forwards and backwards)

## Tools
- Magnet wire (0.4 mm or thinner)
- Neodymium magnets (~4 per speaker)
- Paper cup (1 per speaker)
- Sandpaper (for removing magnet wire enamel insulation)
- Audio source (3.5 mm jack)
- Clear tape
- Scissors

## Steps
> lecture - **practical** - *optional*

- (05:005) Magnets (History) - natural magnetism (lodestone)
- (05:010) Magnetic fields and the Compass (the Earth has a magnetic field)
+ (10:020) **Play with magnets** (could potentially use smartphone compass/sensor)
- (10:030) Discovery of electromagnetism (Ã˜rsted)
- (05:035) Demonstrate electromagnetism
- (05:040) Electromagnets (coils) to create stronger force...and movement
- (10:050) Introduce speaker...
+ (20:070) **Build a speaker**
- (05:075) Brainstorm: how to make the speaker louder?
- (10:085) DC motors
+ (15:100) **Play with brushed DC motor**
