# Build a Brain : Making Things Move
"The reason we evolved a brain is that we need it to generate adaptive and complex movement...movement is the only way we have to affect the world around us" - D. Wolpert

## Magnets

> A mysterious force found in certain types of "magical" materials, ferromagnetism was known about and used for thousands of years, but it was only understood quite recently.

> When electrons move they create a (weak) magnetic field. With clever geometry we can make this field much, much stronger.


## Motors

</p>

> An electric motor converts current into rotation using electromagnets that are turned on and off in a coordinated pattern. Different types of motors (stepper, brushed, or brushless) use different strategies (circuits) for this coordination.

- **TASK**: Play with your brushed DC motor. Spin it forwards *and* backwards...
    - *Challenge*: What are some ways you could change the *speed* with which your motor spins?
> Switching the direction that current flows through your motor will change the direction it spins.

> Oscillating current in a coil creates a dynamic magnetic field. Let's turn these oscillations into sound.
