# The Last Black Box : Control
In this box, you will learn about control...

## Control
Getting a motor to move precisely how you want it to (direction and speed) is very important for *controlling* the behaviour of your robot. A number of very clever strategies have been developed to help you take **control** of your motor.

> We can control a "continuous" range of outputs with a binary digital signal (only 0s and 1s) by switching the output **ON** and **OFF** very quickly. Our "continuous" output is then the average of the percentage of time spent **ON** vs **OFF**. We cal this percentage the "duty cycle", and we call this output control method *pulse width modulation* or **PWM**.

> A servo loop connects feedback from a sensor to the control signals sent to a motor.

> An H-Bridge allows sending current through a motor in both directions, and thus drive forwards *and* backwards.


# Project
### NB3 : Building a PWM Speed Controller
> We can use a digital (binary) signal and a MOSFET to turn a motor **ON** and **OFF**. We can use PWM to change the motor's speed.
