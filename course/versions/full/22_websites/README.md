### HTML
> Hyper-text markup language.

- Create an HTML file. You can start from the simple template here: [HTML (simple)](/boxes/websites/html/simple.html)
- - You should do this on your PC (not NB3) in a VS Code window (or any text editor)
- Open your HTML file in a browser on your PC. Do you see your awesome website?
- Add some more complex layout to your website. Here is an example: [HTML (layout)](/boxes/websites/html/layout.html)
- Find a cool website on the internet. Use the developer tools in your internet browser to "explore" the mess of HTML that underlies this website...and maybe make some creative changes.

### CSS
> Cascading Style Sheets.

- Create a "styles.css" for your website. Add a link to this "stylesheet" in your HTML code. You can start with the examples (HTML and CSS) here: [CSS Examples](/boxes/websites/css/)
- Make your site look cool, and *consistent* across different pages.

### Javascript
> The browser's programming (scripting) language. Has very little to do with Java.
