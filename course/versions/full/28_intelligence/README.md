- Your neural processing unit is made by Google (and distributed by Coral). It contains an EdgeTPU (tensor processing unit) that very efficiently implements the computations used in (feed forward) neural networks. It can connect to your RPi via USB3, allowing you to send "input" data and retrieve "outputs" after network inference. However, in order to communicate with your EdgeTPU, you will need to install some additional libraries.
- Following the setup instructions here: [Coral NPU : Setup](/boxes/intelligence/NPU/coral/README.md)
