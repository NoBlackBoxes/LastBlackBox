# Bootcamp : Signal Processing
Let's learn how to process one-dimensional time series data...like audio waveforms.

## Audio
We will continue our explanation of sound measurement and generation by exploring "signal processing" in Python.

# Project
You should now have all the skills required to make your NB3 "respond" to sound!
  - This could be as simple as detecting a loud ***clap*** and turning on an LED.
  - You could tell NB3 to turn left or right based on the most prominent frequency measured by its ears.
  - Respond to commands, like "Go" and "Stop"...tricky...but doable.
    - *Note*: We will revisit this when we start learning about learning.
