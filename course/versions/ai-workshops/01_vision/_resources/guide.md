# Teaching Guide

## Topics
(Students will have an RPi, Camera, and Mounting Hardware (that tilts))
- Cameras (what is a picture?)
- Segmentation (classical)
 - Thresholding
 - Edges
 - Color (HSV)
 - Tracking (contours)
- AI
 - Why use learning?
  - Run face detection network
  - Gather dataset using NB3
  - Train a network (transfer learning)

TO DO:
 - Update overlay library, more shapes and sprites

## Goal

## Tools

## Steps
> lecture - **practical** - *optional*

- (10:010) Intro (philosophy of the course - NBB)
+ (10:020) **Student survey**
- (05:025) Explain NB3 design (brain regions)
+ (05:030) **Unpack and inspect the kit, add name label (emphasize keeping it organized)**
+ (05:035) **Add rubber feet to NB3 body and explore the brain layout**
- (05:040) Explain atoms (nuclei + electrons), voltage, and conductors
- (05:045) Explain batteries (maybe) and how to measure with a multimeter
+ (05:050) **Measure the voltage of a single AA battery and 4xAA batteries in a holder**
- (05:055) Explain resistance/resistors
+ (05:060) **Measure resistance of at least one resistor in the kit (they should be 470, 1k or 10k)**
- (05:065) Explain current and Ohm's law
- (05:070) Explain how to draw circuits
- (05:075) Explain how to build circuits on a breadboard (and how a breadboard works!)
+ (05:080) **Attach the breadboard(s) to the robot body**
+ (15:095) **Build and measure a voltage divider**
* (10:105) *Explain and use a potentiometer*
- (05:110) Explain light-dependent resistors LDRs
+ (15:125) **Build a light sensor**
