> An electric motor converts current into rotation using electromagnets that are turned on and off in a coordinated pattern. Different types of motors (stepper, brushed, or brushless) use different strategies (circuits) for this coordination.


**TASK**: Play with your brushed DC motor. Spin it forwards *and* backwards...
- - *Challenge*: What are some ways you could change the *speed* with which your motor spins?
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    Switching the direction that current flows through your motor will change the direction it spins.
