> Moving signals from the analog world to the digital world requires converting a continuous voltage into discrete binary values. We can accomplish this with an analog to digital converter, or **ADC**, and here we learn how they work.

- Build the input stage for a 2-bit ADC using the LM339/LM2901 comparator and a resistor ladder.
