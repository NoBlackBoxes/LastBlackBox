### Differential Amplifier
> Signals often have noise. However, this noise is often the same in many places around our circuit. What if we could reject (subtract out) this common noise? A differential amplifier allows us to selectively amplify the difference between a signal (with noise) and background (just noise). They are *very* useful.
