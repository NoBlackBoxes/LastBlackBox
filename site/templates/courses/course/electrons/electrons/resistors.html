> Many materials hold onto their outer electrons and resist their movement. We can create mixtures of these "resisting" materials and better "conducting" materials, often in the form of ceramics, to create **resistors** with a range of different *resistance* values, which we measure in Ohms (&Omega;).


**TASK**: Measure the resistance of your resistors.
- - *Help*: If you are new to measuring resistance with a multimeter, then I recommend that you watch this video: [NB3-Measuring Resistance](https://vimeo.com/1027761453)
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    Your kit contains 470 &Omega;, 1 k&Omega;, and 10 k&Omega; resistors. You should measure these values.
