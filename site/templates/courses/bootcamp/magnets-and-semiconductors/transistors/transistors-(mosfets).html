> MOSFETs are the thing that humans have built more of than anything else. They must be useful! Let's discuss what they are and how they work.


**TASK**: Measure the threshold voltage that opens your MOSFET gate. Compare it to the "expected" range listed in the
- - The datasheet for your MOSFETs can be found here [IRF510](/boxes/transistors/_resources/datasheets/IRF510.pdf) and here [IRL510](/boxes/transistors/_resources/datasheets/IRL510.pdf)
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    The threshold for when current starts to flow through your MOSFET ("Gate-Source Threshold Voltage") should be between 2 to 4 Volts for the IRF510 and 1 to 3 vols for the IRL510. However, the amount of current it allows will rise rapidly up to (and beyond) 10 Volts for the IRF510 and 5 Volts for the IRL510. Check the datasheets (Figure 3).
