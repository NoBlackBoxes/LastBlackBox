<blockquote id="quote"><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: This is <em>weird</em>. Electrons are the things moving. Shouldn't we say that current "flows" from the <strong>(-)</strong> area to the <strong>(+)</strong> area? Unfortunately, current was described before anyone knew about electrons and we are stuck with the following awkward convention: <strong>Current is defined to flow from (+) to (-)</strong>...even though we now know that electrons are moving the opposite direction.</blockquote>
<h4 id="instruction">- <strong>TASK</strong>: Build the simple circuit below and measure the current flowing when you connect the battery pack.</h4>
<h4 id="instruction">- <strong><em>Warning!</em></strong>: Measuring current with a multimeter is <strong><em>tricky</em></strong>. You can only get an accurate measurement if <strong><em>ALL</em></strong> of the current in the circuit is forced to flow through your multimeter. This means that when measuring current, your multimeter must be in <em>series</em> with the rest of the circuit. (As opposed to measuring voltage, when your multimeter is placed "parallel" to the circuit.)</h4>
<h4 id="instruction">- If you are new to measuring current with a multimeter, then I recommend you watch this video: <a id="link" href="https://vimeo.com/??????" target="_blank">NB3-Measuring Current</a>.</h4>
