> We will now start measuring and manipulating electricity, but first we will assemble a "prototyping platform" that also happens to be the **body** of your robot (NB3).


**TASK**: Assemble the robot body (prototyping base board).
- - *Challenge*: If you are curious how the *NB3 Body* printed circuit board (PCB) was designed, then you can find the KiCAD files here: [NB3 Body PCB](/boxes/electrons/NB3_body).

    Your NB3 should now look like [this](/boxes/electrons/NB3_body/NB3_body_front.png). Your breadboards will be different colors...and you should have some rubber feet on the back.
