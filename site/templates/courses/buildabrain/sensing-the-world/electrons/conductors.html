> Some materials have electrons in their outer orbitals that are happy to jump between neighboring atomic nuclei (of the same element). These electrons are "free" to move around the material. If we place such a material between two locations with a *potential difference* (voltage), then electrons will flow from the **(-)** location to the **(+)** location; the material will **conduct** electricity.
