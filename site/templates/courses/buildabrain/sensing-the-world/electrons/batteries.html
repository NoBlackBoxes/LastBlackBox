> Generating a stable voltage requires a renewable source of electrons to maintain a *potential difference*. We can accomplish this with a (redox) chemical reaction inside the wonderfully useful device that we call a **battery**.


**TASK**: Measure the voltage of a AA battery using your multimeter.
- - *Hint*: Select the voltage ("V") setting and touch your probes to either end of the battery. Depending on your multimeter, you may also need to select an appropriate "range". For a single AA battery, you should expect to measure between 1 and 2 Volts.

<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    A single AA battery, fully charged, should have a voltage of ~1.6 Volts. If it is less than 1.5 Volts, then the battery is nearly *dead*.

**TASK**: Measure the voltage of 4xAA batteries in series (end to end).
- - *Hint*: You can use your battery holder.
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    Batteries connected in series will sum their voltages. You should measure four times the voltage of a single AA battery, ~6.4 Volts, from the batteries in your 4xAA holder.
