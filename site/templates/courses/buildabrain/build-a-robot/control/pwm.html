> We can control a "continuous" range of outputs with a binary digital signal (only 0s and 1s) by switching the output **ON** and **OFF** very quickly. Our "continuous" output is then the average of the percentage of time spent **ON** vs **OFF**. We cal this percentage the "duty cycle", and we call this output control method *pulse width modulation* or **PWM**.
