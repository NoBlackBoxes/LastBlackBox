> The chemical and electrical equilibrium between charge carriers creates a potential across the PN junction. This junction potential only permits current flow in one direction, which gives **diodes** there delightfully non-linear behavior.


**TASK**: Illuminate a light-emitting diode (LED). *Remember the current limiting resistor!*
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    The LED should only illuminate when installed in one orientation. If you flip it around, then the "diode" of the LED will prevent current flowing through the circuit.
