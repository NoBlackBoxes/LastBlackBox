### OpenAI API Key
This is a special code that you can get from OpenAI that allows you to send requests to their computers running very large neural networks. Each time you make a request, they charge a very tiny amount of money. This is their business model. I will provide you with an OpenAI API key to use during the course...but please don't share it with the internet. (It has a spending cap, but it will be quickly used up if the "world" gets access.)
