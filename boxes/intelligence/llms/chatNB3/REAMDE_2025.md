# Intelligence :  LLMs : ChatNB3

***Let's have a conversation with our NB3 (powered by Whisper, GPT, and TTS)***

### Microphone (NB3 Ears) ready?
Is at least one of your microphones working? If so, then you should be ready to go!

### Speaker (NB3 Mouth) ready?
Is your speaker working? If so, then you should be ready to go!

## Install required Python packages
```bash
pip install openai
pip install python-dotenv
```

## Environment File
Create a .env in "base_path"
```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj...REST-OF-KEY
```

### OpenAI API Key
This is a special code that you can get from OpenAI that allows you to send requests to their computers running very large neural networks. Each time you make a request, they charge a very tiny amount of money. This is their business model. I will provide you with an OpenAI key to use during the course...but please don't share it with the internet. (It has a spending cap, but it will be quickly used up if the "world" gets access.)
