## Description
Modern computers combine a huge number of different technologies into a functional "system". They still need a core CPU and memory (RAM), but also a graphics processor, a network connection (wired and wireless), and other specialized hardware. All of these hardware devices are coordinated by a sophisticated (and complex) piece of software called an *operating system*.
