## Concepts
- Overview of Pi SoC
- Overview of Pi board layout
- Mount Midbrain
- Attach heatsinks

## Connections

## Lesson

- **Task**: Mount a Raspberry Pi on your robot (and connect its power inputs using your *shortest* jumper cables, 2x5V and 2x0V from the NB3, to the correct GPIO pins on the RPi...please *double-check* the pin numbers)
    - This pinout of the Raspberry Pi GPIO might be useful: [Raspberry Pi GPIO](../../../boxes/systems/_data/images/rpi_GPIO_pinout.png)
