# Systems : Operating Systems
As computer hardware became much more capable, software was developed to manage this complexity and power. This software took responsibility for managing access to the computer's resources: processing, memory, and devices. These days, when we *operate* a computer, we rarely interact directly with the hardware. Instead, we talk to this control software, which we call an **operating system**.

## Concepts
- The problem(s): Multi-task (and multi-user), memory management (and file systems), device drivers.
- Processing: Concurrent execution of multiple tasks (for multiple users): Scheduler
- Memory: Manage tasks access to memory, separate tasks for security, MMU (speed/cache)
- Devices: Abstract away the underlying hardware (hard disk, networking, graphics, IO, etc.)
  - File System: Organize data on hard disk
- Kernel provides resources for applications (user)
- Services: Convenient tools used by applications to access computer resources (user interface, utility programs (shell), system calls)
- Examples: Windows, MacOS, Android, ChromeOS, and Linux
