# Systems: NB3: Programming Concurrency (Arduino)
Getting a microcontroller to perform two tasks, with very different timescales, at the same time is a fun programming challenge. You will develop new skills in organizing your programs and get a glimpse of the problems solved by the *kernel* of a modern operating system.
