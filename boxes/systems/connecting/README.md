# Systems : Connecting

Strategies for connecting to a (remote) system. For additional details, please consult the official documentation: [Raspberry Pi Remote Access](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html)

## General Approach

In order to talk to another computer, we must be able to find it on your network. The following requirements must be met:

1. The *remote* computer (e.g. your NB3's Raspberry Pi) must be connected to your local area network (LAN)
2. Your *host* computer (your development laptop/desktop) must be connected to the **same network**
3. The remote computer must **ALLOW** external connections (e.g. enable an SSH server)
4. You must know the remote computer's **IP address** (or, in some cases, just the "hostname")

### The Setup
The following assumes you have used the [RPi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to create an SD card containing the Raspberry Pi Operating System (RPiOS) ***AND*** configured a hostname, user account (with password), WiFi network name+passkey+country (if available), and **enabled SSH** to use password login. If you have not done so, then please follow the instructions [here](../rpios/README.md)!

## 1. Connecting the NB3 to your LAN
If you have correctly entered the WiFi name (SSID) and passkey while creating the SD card, then your NB3 *should* connect automatically. The following are some ideas for "debugging" if this connection is not made.

- **Wired Connection**: If you have access to your router and an ethernet cable, then simply connect the cable between your router's spare jacks and the NB3's jack. A new device will automatically appear on your network with an assigned IP address (use the tools in Step 4 below to determine this IP address).

- **Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse**: If you have a micro-HDMI (small port on RPi) to HDMI cable, the you can directly connect your NB3 to a monitor/TV. Along with a USB keyboard and mouse, you can then use your NB3 as a full-fledged "desktop" computer. Upon boot, you will see a normal-ish looking graphical desktop with options for connecting to an available WiFi network.

- **Switching WiFi Networks**: If you previously connected your NB3 to a WiFi network, then you can try to connect to a *new* network by creating a "mobile hotspot" with the same WiFi name (SSID) and passkey as the *previous* network. Your NB3 should connect and be assigned an IP address that you can use in the subsequent steps. *Make sure that your Host is also connected to the same hotspot.*

- **UART Console**: Your RPi has the ability to communicate via an old-school serial console. We can use the USB-to-Serial converter on your microcontroller (hindbrain) to talk directly to the RPi via a terminal emulator (minicom, PuTTY, etc.). This trick requires enabling the serial console on your RPi and connecting some jumper cables between your microcontroller and RPi's GPIO pins. You can find details of this *last resot* (but very reliably) connection strategy here: [Connecting via UART](uart/README.md)

### 2. Connecting your Host to your LAN

- Connect your Host to the same WiFi network as the NB3 using whatever strategy you normally use to connect to a WiFi network.

### 3. Enable SSH on the NB3

- This is usually done during the preparation of the SD card image (see above). However, if you have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse connected to your NB3, then you can use the command line tool "raspi-config" to enable SSH under the "Interface Options" menu.

### 4. Determining your NB3's IP address

There are many different software programmes designed to map local networks. I recommend [NMAP](https://nmap.org/download.html), which you can download and install on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Please follow the install instructions for your Host's OS.

1. Determine the "local" IP address of your Host computer

    ```bash
    # Linux or MacOS
    ip address
    # or
    ifconfig

    # Windows
    # From a command line terminal
    ipconfig
    ```
    
    - The IP address of each network device will be listed, if you are connected via WiFi, one device will start with a "w" and the corresponding IP address will *usually* look like this: **192.168.???.???**

2. Map the local network

    ```bash
    nmap 192.168.???.*
    # Use your "host" IP in the command
    ```

    - The output may or may not contain the "hostnames" of connected devices. You are looking for any device with an open port 22 (SSH). There may be multiple...hopefully, ***one of them is your NB3***.

3. *Alternative*: On MacOS (and some Linux distributions), the command "arp" is pre-installed and can achieve similar results to "nmap". If you have trouble installing NMAP, then try the following in your command terminal:

    ```bash
    arp -a
    ```

### Connecting

Now that your Host and NB3 are connected to same local network and you know your NB3's IP address. You can connect using a "secure shell" (i.e. terminal), SSH. There are many different programmes that provide SSH connections. 

- On Linux and MacOS, you should be able to just type the following command into the command terminal:

```bash
ssh username@hostname
# or
ssh username@<NB3's IP Address>
# e.g. ssh user@192.168.1.88
```

- On Windows, you may need to "enable the OpenSSH Client". [See here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui). Alternatively, you can also use [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

These methods work, but there is an even more convenient way to connect to and develop code for your NB3...VSCode's Remote SSH Extension.

### Visual Studio Code's "Remote - SSH" Extension

We will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our tool for writing programs. VS Code is just a simple, *but really powerful*, text editor. It has extensions for all sorts of useful tools (Python, Git, etc.), and for connecting to a "remote" computer (our NB3's Raspberry Pi).

1. Download Visual Studio Code to your Host (laptop/desktop) computer: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

2. Connect to your Raspberry Pi from your Host computer.
    - Install the "Remote - SSH" extension (search for it in the left-hand toolbar "Extensions" menu)
    - Click on the little green box in the lower left corner and select "Connect to Host".

</p>

3. Enter the following in the text command box that appears:

      ```bash
      ssh <your-username>@<NB3-IP-address>
      # Example: ssh adam@192.168.1.121

      # It may also work, without knowing your IP, to enter the following
      ssh <your-username>@<NB3-hostname>
      # Example: ssh adam@NB3
      ```
    - If all goes well, then you should be able to open a "Terminal" window in VS code that is *actually* a command line terminal running on your NB3. You are connected!
    - If all *does not* go well, and it often doesn't, then please check out the "Common Problems" section below.

## Common Problems

### "Known Host" Identification has changed
When you try to connect to your NB3, you may see an error like this...

<p align="center">
<img src="resources/images/ssh_known_host_error.png" alt="SSH Known Host Error" width="700" height="350">
</p>

This is your Host computer/network trying to protect you from someone secretly swapping the remote computer at this address for a different computer, which might be an attempt to trick you into sending personal info somewhere you don't want to send it. This is very likely **NOT** the case with our NB3, but it still means that you won't be able to login/connect until you tell your host that the new "host signature" is OK.

**Note: This error WILL happen after your "reburn" your SD card. You NB3 will often be assigned the same address, but it will now have a different "signature", causing your Host to complain.**

What to do? Simple, delete any previous records of your NB3 in the "known_hosts" file located somewhere on your Host computer. These will be all the records starting with your NB3's assigned IP address.
