# The Last Black Box : Amplifiers
In this box, you will learn about amplifiers...

## Amplifiers
The signals arriving from the environment are often too small to measure reliably with a computer (or brain). We need to make them bigger. Making tiny voltage or current signals larger is called *amplification*, and the things that can do this are ***amplifiers***.

### Differential Amplifier
> Signals often have noise. However, this noise is often the same in many places around our circuit. What if we could reject (subtract out) this common noise? A differential amplifier allows us to selectively amplify the difference between a signal (with noise) and background (just noise). They are *very* useful.


### Op Amps
> Combine *high gain differential amplification* with *negative feedback* to build a much, much better amplifier. We call these devices **operational amplifiers** or **Op Amps**.

- Use an OpAmp to make your speaker louder!
