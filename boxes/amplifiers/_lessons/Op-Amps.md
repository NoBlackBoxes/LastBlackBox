# Amplifiers: Op Amps
Combine *high gain differential amplification* with *negative feedback* to build a much, much better amplifier. We call these devices **operational amplifiers** or **Op Amps**.

## Concepts
- Differential amplification
- Gain
- (Negative) feedback
- The *ideal* op amp

## Connections
