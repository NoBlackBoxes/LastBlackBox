#### Watch this video: [Virtual Environments](https://vimeo.com/1042637566)
> We will next create a Python **virtual environment** on our NB3 that will isolate the specific Python packages we require for the course from the Python packages used by the Raspberry Pi's operating system.

**TASK**: Create a "virtual environment" called LBB
- Follow the instructions here: [virtual environments](../../../boxes/python/virtual_environments/README.md)
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    You should now have a virtual environment activated (and installed in the folder "_tmp/LBB").
</details><hr>

**TASK**: Install some useful packages using PIP
- Install numpy
- Install matplotlib
- Make a cool plot and save it to an image file
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    You should now hav an image of your plot saved, which you can open and view inside VS code.

> What is Python? Where is it? How does it work? How can it work for you?

**TASK**: Say "hello world" in Python
- Print the words "Hello World" on your terminal screen
- Print the words "Hello World" on your terminal screen many, many times
- Print the words "Hello World for the {Nth} time" on your terminal screen, where "Nth" reports the iteration count, i.e. "1", "2", "3"...or (*bonus task*) "1st", "2nd", "3rd", etc.
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    You should see something like "Hello World for the 1st time", "Hello World for the 2nd time", etc. printed line by line in your terminal screen.
