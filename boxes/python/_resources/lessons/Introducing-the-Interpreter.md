# Python : Introducing the Interpreter
What is Python? Where is it? How does it work? How can it work for you?

## Concepts
- Python is an interpreted programming language. It requires an *interpreter*.
- Where is the Python interpreter?
- An interpreter is program running on your operating system. It interprets Python commands into machine code your CPU can understand.
- Executing a command changes the state of the interpreter. It retains memory items you create...until you close the current interpreter.
- You can store commands in a file or execute them in an interactive shell (called IPython).
- Python has a simple syntax, which requires you to use indentation/spacing inside of loops, conditions, etc.
- You can use other libraries by importing them.
- You can install other libraries/packages using Pip, the Python package manager
- The Python extension for VS code can help make it easier to write (and view) Python code by highlighting the syntax
- It is a *good* idea to keep the packages you use separate from those used by your operating system. You can do this by creating a **virtual environment**.

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Say "hello world" in Python
    - Print the words "Hello World" on your terminal screen
    - Print the words "Hello World" on your terminal screen many, many times
    - Print the words "Hello World for the {Nth} time" on your terminal screen, where "Nth" reports the iteration count, i.e. "1", "2", "3"...or (*bonus task*) "1st", "2nd", "3rd", etc.
> You should see something like "Hello World for the 1st time", "Hello World for the 2nd time", etc. printed line by line in your terminal screen.
