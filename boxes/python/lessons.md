# Python
The most popular programming language in the world (i.e. on GitHub).

## [Introduction](https://vimeo.com/1005196173)
> Python is an interpreted language. It requires the Python "interpreter" to be running on your computer, either as an interactive window accepting a commands or by ingesting the commands stored in a (*.py) file.

- **TASK**: Explore Python
> Expected results from playing with Python

## [Virtual Environments](https://vimeo.com/??????)
> We will create a Python virtual environment on our NB3 that will isolate the specific Python packages we require for the course from the Python packages used by Raspberry Pi's operating system.

- **TASK**: Create a "virtual environment" called LBB
  - *Hint*: Follow the instructions here: [Virtual Environments](virtual_environments/README.md)
> You should now have a folder called "LBB" in your temporary (_tmp) folder that contains the Python virtual environment.
