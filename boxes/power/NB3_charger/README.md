# Power : NB3_charger

PCB design and fabrication for NB3 charger, a 5V/3A DC to DC power supply and NiMH battery charger

## Parts
- Battery Holder (Keystone 1028)
  - Substitute LCSC version (C5290180), may require modified footprint
- AP64501SP-13, DC-DC converter, Diodes Inc. [datasheet](libraries/parts/Voltage_Regulator_AP64501/Voltage_Regulator_AP64501.pdf)
- Body Power Connector
  - B4B-PH-SM4-TB (SMD)
  - B4B-PH-K-S (through-hole)

## Fabrication

### Generate files
0. Save front/back renders and 3D model (step)
1. Create "fab" folder in KiCAD project root
2. Export BOM (as CSV): File->Fabrication outputs->BOM
3. Edit BOM: Open as ODS and save as XLSX in "fab" folder
4. Generate Gerbers: File->Fabrication outputs->Gerbers [settings](NB3_charger_FAB_plot_settings.png)
5. Generate Drill: File->Fabrication outputs->Drill Files [settings](NB3_charger_FAB_drill_settings.png)
6. Generate Centroids: File->Fabrication outputs->Componenet Placement [settings](NB3_charger_FAB_pos_settings.png)
7. Zip entire fab folder (including BOM.xlsx)
