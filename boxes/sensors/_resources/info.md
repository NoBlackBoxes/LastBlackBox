## Description
Computers and brains work with electrical signals. In order for either to understand signals in the environment (light, sound, pressure, heat, etc.), then these physical signals must be converted into electrical signals. This conversion is called *transduction* and the thing that does it is a *transducer*. However, given their role in sensing the environment, it is common to call these transduction devices ***sensors***.
