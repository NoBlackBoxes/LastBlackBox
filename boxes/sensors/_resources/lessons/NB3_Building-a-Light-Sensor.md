## Lesson

- **TASK**: Build a light sensor
    - *Hint*: Build a voltage divider with one of the fixed resistors replaced with an LDR (light-dependent resistor). Does the "output" voltage vary with light level? 
    - *Challenge*: What should the value of the fixed resistor be to maximize the sensitive range of the output voltage for varying light levels?
> Your multimeter should measure a change in voltage as you cover your LDR or shine light on it. The voltage will either increase with more light or decrease, depending on whether your LDR is the first or second resistor in the voltage divider circuit.
