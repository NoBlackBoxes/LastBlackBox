# Sensors : Transducers
A sensor converts (transduces) a physical quantity (light, heat, pressure, etc.) into an electrical signal (voltage, current, or resistance).

## Concepts
- A transducer converts a physical quantity we care about (light, heat, pressure, etc.) into an electrical signal that we can measure. We will use them as our robot's input sensors.
- Sensors use a range of different mechanisms.
- A piezo can turn pressure into a voltage.
- A photodiode can convert light into a current.
- A number of very common sensors convert (transduce) physical changes into changes in resistance. Such as thermistor, which changes its resistance at different temperatures.
- However, as we will soon learn...computers (and thus our robot) cannot directly measure resistance. They want to measure voltage.
- How do we convert a change in resistance into a change in voltage?
- You already know how to do this.
- ...a voltage divider.
- We simply replace one of our resistors with this sensor material, such as a thermistor...or this device, an LDR, which changes its internal resistance in response to light!
