# Vision : Stream NB3
Stream live camera images from the NB3 camera. This example uses simple sockets and a bare-bones HTML template.

## Requirements
We use the *netifaces* Python library to find our NB3's IP address (and thus the address we need to connect to in a browser).

```bash
pip install netifaces
```
