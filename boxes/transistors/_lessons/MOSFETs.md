- **Task**: Measure the threshold voltage that opens your MOSFET gate. Compare it to the "expected" range listed in the 
    - The datasheet for your MOSFET can be found here: [IRF510](../../../boxes/transistors/_data/datasheets/IRF510.pdf)
> The threshold for when current starts to flow through your MOSFET ("Gate-Source Threshold Voltage") should be between 2 to 4 Volts. However, the amount of current it allows will rise rapidly up to (and beyond) 10 Volts. Check the datasheet (Figure 3).
