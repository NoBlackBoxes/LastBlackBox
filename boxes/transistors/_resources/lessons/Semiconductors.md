# Transistors : Semiconductors
We can modify a pure crystal of certain elements (e.g. silicon) to change how well they conduct electricity.

## Concepts
- Silicon is an average atom. It has four valence electrons and therefore would like to share four electrons to complete its outer orbital. (Similar to Carbon)
- Silicon, in a pure crystal, can share electrons with other silicon atoms. Carbon makes a similar structure, called a diamond.
- In 3D, the shape is tetrahedral.
- All the electrons are happy. No electrons can flow. Pure silicon is an (expensive) insulator.
- Now, if we mix in some other elements. Let's mix in Phosphor...things change.
- The extra electron of P does not fit in the crystal. It is thus happy to move around between neighboring atoms in the crystal. It can carry a current and conduct electricity.
- Note, Phosphor doped Silicon is still neutral
- We can also try other elements. What if we try ones to the left of Silicon. For example, Boron (which is typically used).
- Boron can only share 3 electrons. The gaps in the crystal are called holes.
- Interestingly, these holes can also move around. However, they move around like + charges would.
- Doped silicon with - charge carries we call N-type..with + charge carriers we call P-type.
- Thus far we have created very expensive resistors....wait until until we bring these two types of silicon together.
