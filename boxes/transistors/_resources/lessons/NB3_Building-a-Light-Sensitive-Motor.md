## Lesson
- **TASK**: Use a MOSFET transistor to control how much current is flowing through your motor and gate the MOSFET with the output voltage from your light sensor...creating a motor that spins when the light is **ON** and stops when the light is **OFF**, or the other way around.
- *Hint*: Use the following circuit as a guide: [MOSFET driver:400](/boxes/transistors/_resources/images/MOSFET_motor_driver.png)
> Your motor should change how fast it spins when you change how much light hits the LDR.
