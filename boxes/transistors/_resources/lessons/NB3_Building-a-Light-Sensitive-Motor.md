# Transistors : NB3 : Building a Light-Sensitive Motor
Use a MOSFET transistor to control how much current is flowing through your motor. Gate the MOSFET with the output voltage of your light sensor...creating a motor that spins when the light is **ON** and stops when the light is **OFF**, or the other way around.
