# Websites : Javascript
Javascript is the web browser's programming (scripting) language. It has very little to do with Java, but it is the main way to add "interaction" to websites. Everyone should know a little bit of Javascript. Also, given that everyone has access to a web browser, it is one of the easiest programming environments to setup and start playing around.

## Concepts
- HTML and CSS can be used to make pretty websites.
- However, to make websites interactive, the world needed a "scripting language" that ran in the web browser, which could respond to user clicks and events (and much more).
- For example, when you click a "Buy Now" button on a website, some Javascript code runs in the browser to make your purchase actually happen.

## Lesson
- Add some (Javascript) code to your website to make it more interactive.
- Here is an example to respond to a "button press" by hiding/revealing the navigation bar in a simple website: [Button Response](/boxes/websites/javascript/alternates/toggle.js)
- Here is another example to gets the current time and updates a live clock page: [Live Clock](/boxes/websites/javascript/alternates/clock.js)
- There is way more you can do with Javascript. Have fun exploring and learning!
