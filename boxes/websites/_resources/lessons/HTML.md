# Websites : HTML
Hyper-text markup language.

## [Video]()

## Concepts
- HTML is just...a text file (with special tags, i.e. markup, to control formatting)
- Create a simple example and open in browser
- Make a more complex layout
- Look at examples online, edit in developer mode
- This is the data passed around by the web, which often looks complex (it is usually generated by software), but it does not need to be.

## Lesson
- Create an HTML file. You can start from the simple template here: [HTML (simple)](/boxes/websites/html/simple.html)
  - You should do this on your PC (not NB3) in a VS Code window (or any text editor)
- Open your HTML file in a browser on your PC. Do you see your awesome website?
- Add some more complex layout to your website. Here is an example: [HTML (layout)](/boxes/websites/html/layout.html)
- Find a cool website on the internet. Use the developer tools in your internet browser to "explore" the mess of HTML that underlies this website...and maybe make some creative changes.
