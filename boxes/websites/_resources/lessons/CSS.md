# Websites : CSS
Cascading Style Sheets.

## [Video]()

## Concepts
- Websites often have a particular "look-and-feel"...a *style*: similar fonts, color schemes, etc.
- It can be tedious to apply the same style to every HTML page that is part of your website. For example, if you wanted to change the font, then you would have to go to each separate HTML file and update the font name.
- CSS (cascading style sheets) allow you to "include" a specific style (stored in a .css file) in every HTML page that uses that style. You then only need to make changes in one place (the CSS file) to update the "look-and-feel" of your entire website.

## Lesson
- Create a "styles.css" for your website. Add a link to this "stylesheet" in your HTML code. You can start with the examples (HTML and CSS) here: [CSS Examples](/boxes/websites/css/)
- Make your site look cool, and *consistent* across different pages.
