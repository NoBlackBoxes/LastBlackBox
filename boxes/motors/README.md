# The Last Black Box : Motors
In this box, you will learn about motors...

## Motors
Clever arrangements of electromagnets and their control circuits can be used to produce a rotational force. You will use these devices to make your NB3 move!

#### Watch this video: [DC Motors](https://vimeo.com/1031627739)
> An electric motor converts current into rotation using electromagnets that are turned on and off in a coordinated pattern. Different types of motors (stepper, brushed, or brushless) use different strategies (circuits) for this coordination.


**TASK**: Play with your brushed DC motor. Spin it forwards *and* backwards...
- - *Challenge*: What are some ways you could change the *speed* with which your motor spins?
<details><summary><strong>Target</strong></summary>
    Switching the direction that current flows through your motor will change the direction it spins.
