> An electric motor converts current into rotation using electromagnets that are turned on and off in a coordinated pattern. Different types of motors (stepper, brushed, or brushless) use different strategies (circuits) for this coordination.

- **TASK**: Play with your brushed DC motor. Spin it forwards *and* backwards...
    - *Challenge*: What are some ways you could change the *speed* with which your motor spins?
> Switching the direction that current flows through your motor will change the direction it spins.
