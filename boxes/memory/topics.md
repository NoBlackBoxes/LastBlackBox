### Topics

- State, stable bits
- (Explain NOR latch first, 0 - 0 input is bistable... 1 - 1 is bistable for NAND latch...more confusing to consider from power up state)
- Latch (bi-stable via feedback)
- Flip-Flop
- Shift register
- SRAM
- DRAM
- Flash

#### Tools

- Components (NAND gates for SR latch)
