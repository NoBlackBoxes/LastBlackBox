# Magnets: Electromagnetism
When electrons move they create a (weak) magnetic field. With clever geometry we can make this field much, much stronger.

## Concepts
- For millennia, magnetism and electricity were considered interesting, but entirely unrelated phenomena.
- Until a scientist in Denmark, who had been using Volta's batteries to study electricity noticed something surprising.
- Demonstrate impact of current on a compass.
- Moving electrons create a magnetic field.
- This magnetic field spirals around the conductor.
- It is very weak.
- We can arrange (bend) the conductor ot make it much, much stronger.
