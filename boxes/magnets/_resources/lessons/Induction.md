# Magnets : Induction
A *changing* magnetic field **induces** an electromotive force on charged particles (and current in a complete conducting circuit). This electromagnetic induction is key to building time-dependent electronic circuits (such as filters) and generating the electricity we use in our homes.

## Concepts
- When a magnet (magnetic field) moves past a conductor it can induce a current.
- Discovered by Faraday in the 1830s at the Royal Institution in London.
- Induction is the basis of electrical generators used in power plants, converting the mechanical movement of a large magnet into electrical current that powers our homes.
- It is also useful to build time-varying electrical circuits, such as filters and oscillators.
- Demo a simple inductor circuit with LED.
