# Magnets : NB3 : Building a Speaker
Oscillating current in a coil creates a dynamic magnetic field. Let's turn these oscillations into sound.

## Concepts
- We are going to use an electromagnet to produce sound.
- Sound is just vibrations in air.
- We can build an electromagnetic coil and send current through it in both directions. If we put that coil near a permanent magnet, then it will shake.
- If we attach our coil to a larger surface, here we will use a paper cup, then the shaking magnetic coil will shake the air in the cup...which we should eb able to hear.
- Where do we get current going in both directions, oscillating at the frequencies of sound we want to hear...from any source of music you can find on one of your devices.
