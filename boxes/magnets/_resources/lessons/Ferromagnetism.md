# Magnets : Ferromagnetism
A mysterious force found in certain types of "magical" materials, ferromagnetism was known about and used for thousands of years, but it was only understood quite recently.

## Concepts
- Magnetic rocks ("lodestone in particular") occur naturally and have been studied for thousands of years.
- They proved useful in the construction of a very important device for navigation, the compass, which aligns with the Earth's own magnetic field.
- However, the origin of this magnetism, and the atomic basis of ferromagnetism, was only understood with the development of quantum mechanics about 100 years ago.
- The atomic picture involves looking in more detail at the properties of atoms, and in particular, electrons.
- Electrons have both an electric charge, which holds them to their nucleus, but also a magnetic "spin".
- This spin can be either up or down, and only up or down, and QM dictates that electrons will form pairs of up/down electrons in each orbital.
- Only atoms with unpaired electrons can be magnetic.
- However, of the possible elements, only a few show strong ferromagnetism. Why is this?
- Elements in the fourth row, Nickel, Cobalt, and Iron in particular show strong magnetism. 
- As we move further out in the orbitals, electrons become less picky about which sub-orbital they choose to occupy.
- In Iron, up to 4 electrons occupy sub-orbitals as unpaired electrons. This give Iron is strong magnetic dipole.
- ...but this is not enough.
- In a material, the alignment of each atoms dipole with its neighbors is also necessary. Iron is particularly capable, especially in the crystalline form it is found naturally, called Magnetite, to align most of the individual dipoles in the same direction, which amplifies the magnetic field into something we cn feel, and use.
- More recently, scientists started looking further out in the table...to the Lanthanides, which like Iron have many unpaired electrons.
- They found ways to make stable crystals, using other alloys, which is how the super strong "rare earth" neodymium magnets included in your kit are made.
