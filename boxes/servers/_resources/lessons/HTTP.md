# Servers : HTTP
The fundamental "application layer" protocol of the internet is HTTP...the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, which your web browser (the client) uses to *request* HTML files (and other resources) from a server anywhere on the internet. Here we will build a *very simple* HTTP server in Python.

## Concepts
- Client-Server model: client makes request, and server "serves" its response to the client
- Web server (HTTP server): client requests HTML file (and other types of files), and the server responds with that resource (if available)
- Example #1: "simplest" socket http server (just serve the same HTML file)
- Example #2: "simple" but more capable socket server (handle links...)
- More capable servers can handle more types of requests. They can also handle multiple requests arriving from multiple clients at the same time. We will take a look at a more capable server in the next video.
