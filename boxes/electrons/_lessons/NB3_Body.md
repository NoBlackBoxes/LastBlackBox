# Electrons: NB3: Body
To help you start measuring and manipulating electricity, we will first assemble a "prototyping platform", which also happens to be the **body** of your robot (NB3).

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Assemble the robot body (prototyping base board).
  - *Challenge*: If you are curious how the *NB3 Body* printed circuit board (PCB) was designed, then you can find the KiCAD files here: [NB3 Body PCB](../../../boxes/electrons/NB3_body). You can also watch this short introduction to PCB design with KiCAD here: [NB3-Designing PCBs with KiCAD](https://vimeo.com/??????).
> Your NB3 should now look like [this](../../../boxes/electrons/NB3_body/NB3_body_front.png). Your breadboards will be different colors...and you should have some rubber feet on the back.
