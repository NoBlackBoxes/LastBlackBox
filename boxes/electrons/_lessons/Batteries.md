# Electrons: Batteries
Generating a stable voltage requires a renewable source of electrons to maintain a *potential difference*. We can accomplish this with a (redox) chemical reaction inside the wonderfully useful device we call a **battery**.

## Concepts
- Maintaining potential differences was key to understanding electricity and building electronic devices
- Chemical reactions (redox) can create potential differences
- Zinc (oxidized) vs Copper (reduced): Zn dissolves into solution, leaving behind 2 negative...become negative
- AA batteries
- Other battery chemistries
- Demonstrate a voltaic pile

## Connections

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Measure the voltage of a AA battery using your multimeter.
  - *Hint*: Select the voltage ("V") setting and touch your probes to either end of the battery. Depending on your multimeter, you may also need to select an appropriate "range". For a single AA battery, you should expect to measure between 1 and 2 Volts.
  - *Help*: If you are new to measuring voltage with a multimeter, then I recommend you watch this video: [NB3-Measuring Voltage](https://vimeo.com/??????)
> A single AA battery, fully charged, should have a voltage of ~1.6 Volts. If it is less than 1.5 Volts, then the battery is nearly *dead*.

- **TASK**: Measure the voltage of 4xAA batteries in series (end to end).
  - *Hint*: You can use your battery holder.
> Batteries connected in series will sum their voltages. You should measure four times the voltage of a single AA battery, ~6.4 Volts, from the batteries in your 4xAA holder.
