# Electrons: Batteries
Generating a stable voltage requires a renewable source of electrons to maintain a *potential difference*. We can accomplish this with a (redox) chemical reaction inside the wonderfully useful device we call a **battery**.

## Concepts
- Maintaining a stable potential difference was key to understanding electricity and building electronic devices, how can we do this?
- Convert chemical energy into electrical energy!
- Oxidation and reduction (redox) reactions add/remove electrons from materials (OILRIG)...let's combine a material that oxidizes with a material that reduces.
- This is called a battery. Batteries are a combination of two materials, one that is oxidized and one that is reduced.
- The reaction will only run up to a point where the accumulated charge, - or +, is balanced by the chemical reaction.
- We can continue the reaction by letting the excess negative charge flow to the area with less negative charge.
- Battery chemistry determines the voltage of a single cell, the rate the reaction can run, and whether it is reversible (rechargeable)
- Alkaline batteries use Zinc and Manganese, to achieve a fresh voltage of ~1.6 volts
- NiMH use Nickel and a mix of different metals (alloys), 1.2 volts, faster reaction, rechargeable
- Lithium-Ion batteries use Lithium, in different combinations with other materials, for both electrodes. Lithium is very reactive...and can reach hig voltages (3.7 volts per cell, and high discharge rates....in high density.) They are also dangerous.

- Batteries in series.
- If we connect the cathode (+) of the lower cell (Zn) to the anode (-) of the upper cell (Cu). The excess anode electrons can flow to the cathode and then through the electrolyte to the final anode, allowing even more oxida???? I have no idea


- First discovered in the 1780s by Galvani and then extended by Volta, they both used a combination of Zinc and Copper
- When Zinc is oxidized, it loses 2 electrons, but nothing interesting happens until the Zinc is placed in a solution.
- In an electrolyte, the liberated Zn2 dissolves away. Leaving the two electrons behind, and the electrode becomes more and more negative as more Zinc dissolves.
- Eventually, the electrode is so negative, that the spontaneous oxidation of additional Zinc can not occur. A balance is reached between the chemical reaction and the electric charge/potential.
- The reaction stops at a certain potential based on how "reactive" the particular metal is. Zinc stops around 0.76 Volts.
- If we want the reaction to continue, then we need to get rid of the extra electrons.
- We can do this by connecting the Zinc, with a conductor, to another material, also in solution.
- We cannot use another piece of Zinc, because it will have accumulated the same number of extra electrons (the negative charge), and no current will flow.
- We need to use a different material. One that is less reactive would work, like Copper, as it will be less charged and then the extra Zinc electrodes can flow into the Copper.
- We could also use a material that "shed electrons" in solution.
- Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is reduced when it combines with water and free electrons. By taking electrons off the electrode, this reduction makes the electrode more positive...until there are no more free electrons.
- If we connect a piece of Zinc to a piece of MnO2, then they work together. The left behind electrodes of the oxidized Zinc feeds the reduction of the MnO2...with the resultant current capable of powering an electronic circuit.
- This is an Alkaline battery. (where the "alkaline" describes the solution, often KOH, which is a base and improves the performance of the reaction)



- Metals in solution lose electrons
- Chemical reactions (redox) can create potential differences
- O.I.L.R.I.G.
- Zn is oxidized an Zn2+ dissolves into the solution, loses electrons. The Zn then becomes more and more negative. Eventually no more Zn can dissolve...unless we remove the electrons by connecting it to another material...that is less likely to lose electrons (in this case copper). The electrons flow from the Zn to the copper via a conductor...and then the reaction can continue until the Zn electrode is dissolved enough.

- In 1780s Galvani discovered that a frog leg would twitch when contacted by wires connected to a stack of two different metals
- Volta soon discovered that the frog was not necessary. The stack of different metals would itself generate a electromotive force
- Zinc at the surface is oxidized and dissolves into the solution, leaving behind 2 negative electrons: Zn â†’ Zn2+ + 2e-, the Zn becomes negative (loses the electron to the surface electrode)
- Cupper receives/accepts 2 hydrogen ions from the solution
- AA batteries
- Other battery chemistries
- Demonstrate a voltaic pile

## Connections

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Measure the voltage of a AA battery using your multimeter.
  - *Hint*: Select the voltage ("V") setting and touch your probes to either end of the battery. Depending on your multimeter, you may also need to select an appropriate "range". For a single AA battery, you should expect to measure between 1 and 2 Volts.
  - *Help*: If you are new to measuring voltage with a multimeter, then I recommend you watch this video: [NB3-Measuring Voltage](https://vimeo.com/??????)
> A single AA battery, fully charged, should have a voltage of ~1.6 Volts. If it is less than 1.5 Volts, then the battery is nearly *dead*.

- **TASK**: Measure the voltage of 4xAA batteries in series (end to end).
  - *Hint*: You can use your battery holder.
> Batteries connected in series will sum their voltages. You should measure four times the voltage of a single AA battery, ~6.4 Volts, from the batteries in your 4xAA holder.
