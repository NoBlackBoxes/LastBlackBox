# Electrons: Batteries
Generating a stable voltage requires a renewable source of electrons to maintain a *potential difference*. We can accomplish this with a (redox) chemical reaction inside the wonderfully useful device we call a **battery**.

## Concepts
- Maintaining a stable potential differences was key to understanding electricity and building electronic devices
- Metals in solution lose electrons
- Chemical reactions (redox) can create potential differences
- O.I.L.R.I.G.
- Zn is oxidized an Zn2+ dissolves into the solution, loses electrons. The Zn then becomes more and more negative. Eventually no more Zn can dissolve...unless we remove the electrons by connecting it to another material...that is less likely to lose electrons (in this case copper). The electrons flow from the Zn to the copper via a conductor...and then the reaction can continue until the Zn electrode is dissolved enough.

- In 1780s Galvani discovered that a frog leg would twitch when contacted by wires connected to a stack of two different metals
- Volta soon discovered that the frog was not necessary. The stack of different metals would itself generate a electromotive force
- Zinc at the surface is oxidized and dissolves into the solution, leaving behind 2 negative electrons: Zn â†’ Zn2+ + 2e-, the Zn becomes negative (loses the electron to the surface electrode)
- Cupper receives/accepts 2 hydrogen ions from the solution
- AA batteries
- Other battery chemistries
- Demonstrate a voltaic pile

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Measure the voltage of a AA battery using your multimeter.
  - *Hint*: Select the voltage ("V") setting and touch your probes to either end of the battery. Depending on your multimeter, you may also need to select an appropriate "range". For a single AA battery, you should expect to measure between 1 and 2 Volts.
  - *Help*: If you are new to measuring voltage with a multimeter, then I recommend you watch this video: [NB3-Measuring Voltage](https://vimeo.com/??????)
> A single AA battery, fully charged, should have a voltage of ~1.6 Volts. If it is less than 1.5 Volts, then the battery is nearly *dead*.

- **TASK**: Measure the voltage of 4xAA batteries in series (end to end).
  - *Hint*: You can use your battery holder.
> Batteries connected in series will sum their voltages. You should measure four times the voltage of a single AA battery, ~6.4 Volts, from the batteries in your 4xAA holder.
