# Electrons: NB3: Building Circuits
With a voltage source (battery) and resistors, then we can start building "circuits" - complete paths of conduction that allow current to flow from a location with *less* electrons **(+)** to a location with *more* electrons **(-)**.

## Lesson

- *Note*: This is *weird*. Electrons are the things moving. Shouldn't we say that current "flows" from the **(-)** area to the **(+)** area? Unfortunately, current was described before anyone knew about electrons and we are stuck with the following awkward convention: **Current is defined to flow from (+) to (-)**...even though we now know that electrons are moving the opposite direction.

- **TASK**: Build the simple circuit below and measure the current flowing when you connect the battery pack.
  - *Warning*: Measuring current with a multimeter is ***tricky***. You can only get an accurate measurement if ***ALL*** of the current in the circuit is forced to flow through your multimeter. This means that when measuring current, your multimeter must be in *series* with the rest of the circuit. (As opposed to measuring voltage, when your multimeter is placed "parallel" to the circuit.)
  - *Help*: If you are new to measuring current with a multimeter, then I recommend you watch this video: [NB3-Measuring Current](https://vimeo.com/??????).
> Not too much current...and do not break your meter.
