# Electrons: Voltage Dividers
Controlling the level of voltage at different places in a circuit is critical to designing electronic devices.

## Lesson

- **TASK**:Build a voltage divider using two resistors of the same value. Measure the intermediate voltage (between the resistors).
> With equal size resistors, the intermediate voltage you measure should be half of the supply voltage.

- **TASK**:Build a voltage divider using a variable resistor (potentiometer). Measure the intermediate voltage. What happens when you change the position of the internal contact of the variable resistor (by turning the screw)?
  - *Help*: A video guide to completing these tasks can be found here: [NB3-Building Voltage Dividers](https://vimeo.com/1000789632)
> The intermediate voltage should vary continuously as you adjust the potentiometer.
