# Electrons: Electric Fields
A very useful, and quite simple, depiction of the lines of force surrounding charged particles.

## [Video]()

## Concepts
- We will encounter the idea of electric (and other) fields throughout the course. 
- An electric field describes the force surrounding a charged particle as experienced by another charge.
- Electric fields "superimpose". They add together at every point in space.

## Connections

## Lesson

- Draw the electric field around a negative charge and positive charge separated by a small distance. Use the following image as a starting point.
