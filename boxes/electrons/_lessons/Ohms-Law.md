# Electrons: Ohm's Law
Ohm's Law describes the relationship between Voltage, Current, and Resistance. It is not complicated, but it is very useful.

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Does Ohm's Law hold? You know the voltage of the batteries (V) and the resistance of the resistor (R). Measure the current flowing (I) for different resistors and confirm that V = I*R.
> For the resistors in your kit, then Ohm's Law should determine the current you measure.
