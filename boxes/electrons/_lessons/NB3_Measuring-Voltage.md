# Electrons: NB3: Measuring Voltage
How to measure voltage with a digital multimeter.

## [Video](https://vimeo.com/1027762531)

## Concepts
- Measure difference between two points (the potential difference)
- Measure batteries (AA charged, AA dead, 9V...dead?)
- Voltage measurements should not influence the circuit being measured (measure in parallel)
- Reference electrode normally at ground
- Example circuit (3 resistor voltage divider)
- More complex example (PCB)
