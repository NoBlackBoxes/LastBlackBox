# Electrons

Electrons are sub-atomic particles with a negative electric charge. Their negative charge produces a *force* that attracts positive charges and repels negative charges.

In this box, we will learn about electricity...how to measure it and how to **control** it.

### Required Materials

- {01}: NBB-11, multimeter
- {10}: NBB-21, multimeter
- {11}: NBB-31, multimeter, oscilliscope

## Electric Fields

Electric fields describe the force that a charged particle feels when nearby another charged particle.

- **Task**(draw_a_dipole_field): Draw the electric field around an electron(-) and a proton(+) seperated by some small distance (as experienced by another electon). Upload a photo of your field drawing. [photo]

## Voltage

Voltage describes the difference in net charge in one location versus another.

## Batteries

Producing a stable voltage was hard, but very useful.

## Measuring Voltage

We can measure voltage (and other electrical properties) with a multi-meter.

- **Task**(measure_AA_battery): Measure the voltage of a AA battery. Enter your measurement [number].
- **Task**(measure_4xAA_batteries): Measure the voltage of 4xAA batteries in series (i.e. in your battery holder). Enter your measurement here [number].

## Conductors

Some materials have electrons that are very loosely connected to their atom's nucleus. In a material made up of many atom's of this type, then the electrons can hop from nucleus to nucleus. The electrons can "move". We call these materials conductors.

## Resistors

In other materials, some electrons are free and others are not. They can move, but not as well. They experience resistance. We call these materials resitors, and they will help us *control* electricity.

## Measuring Resistance

We can measure resitance (and other electrical properties) with a multi-mteter.
