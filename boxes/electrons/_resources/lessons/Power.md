# Electrons : Power
When electrons move through a circuit, they deliver power (some amount of energy in some amount of time). This power can be used to do useful things: make a motor move, light a lamp, or generate heat. If we deliver too little power, then our electronic device may not work as designed. If we deliver too much, then it may never work again. We measure power in Watts.

## Concepts
- When electrons move through a circuit, they deliver power (some amount of energy in some amount of time).
- We measure power in Watts (energy (Joules)/second).
- The amount of power a circuit delivers is related to the amount of voltage and the amount of current.
- Power = V * I.
- In an Ohmic circuit, we can use Ohm's Law to determine how power relates to resistance. Power = V^2/R.
- Knowing the amount of power your device needs is important (in picking an adequate power supply).
- Knowing the amount of power your "power supply" can deliver is important (in making sure your device will work).
- Knowing the amount of power your device "can handle" is important (to prevent damage).
- A demo, with a 1/4 Watt resistor. (0.25 = 6V^2 / R).
