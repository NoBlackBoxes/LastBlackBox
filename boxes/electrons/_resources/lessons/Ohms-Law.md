# Electrons : Ohm's Law
Ohm's Law describes the relationship between Voltage, Current, and Resistance. It is not complicated, but it is very useful.

## Concepts
- Ohm's Law describes the relationship between V, I, and R.
- It is fairly intuitive. The harder you push, the more current will flow. The more you resist, the less.
- V = IR
- This is a linear relationship...if every device behaves appropriately.
- Draw an IV curve. Current on Y, voltage on X.

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Does Ohm's Law hold? You know the voltage of the batteries (V) and the resistance of the resistor (R). Measure the current flowing (I) for different resistors and confirm that V = I*R.
> For the resistors in your kit, then Ohm's Law should determine the current you measure.
