# Electrons : NB3 : Building a Battery
Let's build a version of the *first* battery, and use it to power an LED.

## Concepts
- The "Voltaic Pile", first discovered in the 1780s by Galvani and then extended by Volta, used a combination of Zinc and Copper.
- When Zinc is oxidized, it loses 2 electrons, but nothing interesting happens until the Zinc is placed in a solution.
- In an electrolyte solution, the liberated Zn2+ dissolves away. Leaving two electrons behind, and the electrode becomes more and more negative as more Zinc dissolves and more electrons accumulate.
- Eventually, the electrode is so negative that the spontaneous oxidation of additional Zinc cannot occur. A balance is reached between the chemical reaction and the electric potential.
- The reaction stops at a certain potential based on how "reactive" the particular metal is. Zinc stops around 0.76 Volts.
- If we want the reaction to continue, then we need to get rid of the extra electrons.
- We can do this by connecting the Zinc, with a conductor, to another material, also in solution.
- We cannot use another piece of Zinc, because it will have accumulated the same number of extra electrons (the negative charge), and no current will flow.
- We need to use a different material. One that is less reactive would work, like Copper, as it will be less charged and then the extra Zinc electrons can flow into the Copper.
- We can stack Zn-Cu cells into a pile to create more voltage. This connects the cells in series.
- If we get sufficient voltage, then we power something useful...such as an LED.

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Build a simple battery
  - Combine two different metals, one that oxidizes well and one that does not, and connect them together with a layer of electrolyte between (salt water soaked paper works fine, so does a piece of fruit).
> You should see a voltage if you choose your two metals wisely. Zinc and Copper should produce ~0.76 Volts. If you stack multiple cells in series, then the resulting voltage should sum.
