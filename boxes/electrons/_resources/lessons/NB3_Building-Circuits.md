# Electrons : NB3 : Building Circuits
With a voltage source (battery) and resistors, then we can start building "circuits" - complete paths of conduction that allow current to flow from a location with *less* electrons **(+)** to a location with *more* electrons **(-)**.

## Concepts
- A circuit is a compete route of electrical connection. A path for electrons to flow from an area of excess electrons to an area with fewer.
- We will start by drawing a schematic of a circuit. Then spend most of our time explaining how to build a real version of ths schematic.
- This will entail learning about "solderless breadboards", our prototyping circuit boards. How to use them. How they are connected internally...and a few other tricks.
- Here is the simplest possible circuit. One voltage source, some wires, and a single resistor.
- We could make this circuit by just touching the contacts together in the correct order. However, this does not scale to more complex circuits.
- We will build this circuit on our NB3's large hindbrain breadboard. This makes our life easier.
- Solderless breadboards are prototyping devices that make building circuits much easier.
- They consist of many small holes where you can insert rigid pins, such as the ends of resistor or jumper cable.
- Hint, sometimes it is hard to insert the pins. Using the jumper cable pins, which are more rigid than some of the other devices we will be connecting, can open the hole and make it easier to insert a flimsy resistor lead.

## Connections

## Lesson

- *Note*: This is *weird*. Electrons are the things moving. Shouldn't we say that current "flows" from the **(-)** area to the **(+)** area? Unfortunately, current was described before anyone knew about electrons and we are stuck with the following awkward convention: **Current is defined to flow from (+) to (-)**...even though we now know that electrons are moving the opposite direction.

- **TASK**: Build the simple circuit below and measure the current flowing when you connect the battery pack.
  - *Warning*: Measuring current with a multimeter is ***tricky***. You can only get an accurate measurement if ***ALL*** of the current in the circuit is forced to flow through your multimeter. This means that when measuring current, your multimeter must be in *series* with the rest of the circuit. (As opposed to measuring voltage, when your multimeter is placed "parallel" to the circuit.)
  - *Help*: If you are new to measuring current with a multimeter, then I recommend you watch this video: [NB3-Measuring Current](https://vimeo.com/1027757287).
> Not too much current...and do not break your multimeter.
