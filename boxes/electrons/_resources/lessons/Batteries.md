# Electrons: Batteries
Generating a stable voltage requires a renewable source of electrons to maintain a *potential difference*. We can accomplish this with a (redox) chemical reaction inside the wonderfully useful device that we call a **battery**.

## Concepts
- Maintaining a stable potential difference was key to understanding electricity and building electronic devices, how can we do this?
- Convert chemical energy into electrical energy!
- Oxidation and reduction (redox) reactions add/remove electrons from materials (OILRIG).
- Example of oxidation, rust.
- Batteries are a combination of two materials, one that is oxidized and one that is reduced.
- Batteries will supply electrons as the fast as the chemical reaction can run (some run faster than others).
- When the chemical reaction finishes (all the material is used up), then the battery is dead.
- Different battery designs can store more chemical reactants in smaller space (they are more energy dense).
- Also, some batteries use a chemical reaction that can run in reverse, these batteries can be recharged.
- Let's look at some batteries
- Batteries come in many shapes and sizes (show batteries)...and chemistries.
- The standard Alkaline battery uses Zinc (oxidized) and Manganese DiOxide (reduced). It generates a voltage of ~1.6 volts and can supply >2500 mAH (2.5 amps for an hour). Then it is finished.
- Lithium based batteries are the most reactive. They produce a larger voltage (3.7 Volts), a faster delivery of current, and can be made very compact. However, they can also be dangerous. We don't use them...but your smartphone does.
- The Nickel and Metal hydride batteries, which we use in this course, can supply electrons faster than Alkaline batteries (the chemical reaction runs quicker) and it can run in reverse! It produces 1.2 volts when fully charged, and typically stores about 2000 mAH.
- 1.2 volts is not enough voltage to run our NB3 robot, which require at least 5 volts. Fortunately, we can stack batteries end-to-end adn the potential differences will add up. Batteries connected in series will sum their voltages.
- We will use an 8 cell pack of NiMH batteries to power our NB3, which can deliver up to 9.6 Volts.
- We will also use 4xAA batteries placed in a holder that connects each battery in series. It delivers 1.6x4 volts, or roughly 6.4 volts.

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Measure the voltage of a AA battery using your multimeter.
  - *Hint*: Select the voltage ("V") setting and touch your probes to either end of the battery. Depending on your multimeter, you may also need to select an appropriate "range". For a single AA battery, you should expect to measure between 1 and 2 Volts.
  - *Help*: If you are new to using a multimeter, then I recommend that you watch this video: [NB3-Multimeter Basics](https://vimeo.com/1027764019)

> A single AA battery, fully charged, should have a voltage of ~1.6 Volts. If it is less than 1.5 Volts, then the battery is nearly *dead*.

- **TASK**: Measure the voltage of 4xAA batteries in series (end to end).
  - *Hint*: You can use your battery holder.
> Batteries connected in series will sum their voltages. You should measure four times the voltage of a single AA battery, ~6.4 Volts, from the batteries in your 4xAA holder.
