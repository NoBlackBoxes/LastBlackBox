# Electrons : Current
The rate at which electrons flow, measured as *#charges / second*, is called **current**. We use the unit *Amps* (A) and the circuit symbol **I**.

## Concepts
- Current is just a term we use to describe the rate at which electrons flow past a point.
- The unit of current is Amps, which equals Coulombs (a unit of charge) per second.
- In electronics, we mostly just care about electrons moving, but current was described *before* we knew electrons existed. Therefore, "conventional current" is defined to flow the opposite way, from **(+)** to **(-)**, even though we know it is electrons moving from **(-)** to **(+)**.
