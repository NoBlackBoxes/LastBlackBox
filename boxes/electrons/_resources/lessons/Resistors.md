# Electrons : Resistors
Many materials hold onto their outer electrons and resist their movement. We can create mixtures of these "resisting" materials and better "conducting" materials, often in the form of ceramics, to create **resistors** with a range of different *resistance* values, which we measure in Ohms (&Omega;).

## Concepts
- Conductors are special, given the ease with which their outermost electrons can move between atoms.
- Most materials hold on to their electrons, to different degrees, and resist their movement.
- A material that *strongly* holds onto their electrons, we call an insulator. Silicon, Wood. Plastics.
- We can mix conductors with materials that offer resistance to create a range of **resistance** values.
- We call these devices resistors. They are often made of cermets (ceramic + metals).
- Another common such material is a mixture of Nickel and Chromium. Longer paths of NiCr (Nichrome) have more resistance than shorter paths. This is how your resistors in the kit are made. We call them Metal-Film resistors.
- This is how the "metal film" resistors in your kit are made.
- We use Ohms as our unit of resistance.
- The symbol for a resistor.
- When we connect resistors in series, the total resistance is the the sum.
- When we connect resistors in parallel, the net resistance decreases. 1/R = 1/(R1 + 1/R2) or R = (1/R1 + 1/R2)^-1. For example, if both R1 and R2 are 100 Ohms, then we get R = (2/100)^-1 or 50 Ohms through both.
- Resistor color codes
- Power ratings (1/4 Watt)

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Measure the resistance of your resistors.
  - *Help*: If you are new to measuring resistance with a multimeter, then I recommend that you watch this video: [NB3-Measuring Resistance](https://vimeo.com/1027761453)
> Your kit contains 470 &Omega;, 1 k&Omega;, and 10 k&Omega; resistors. You should measure these values.
