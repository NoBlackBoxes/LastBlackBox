# Electrons: Conductors
Some materials have electrons in their outer orbitals that are happy to jump between neighboring atomic nuclei (of the same element). These electrons are "free" to move around the material. If we place such a material between two locations with a *potential difference* (voltage), then electrons will flow from the **(-)** location to the **(+)** location; the material will **conduct** electricity.

## Concepts
- With a potential difference, nothing will happen until you provide a path for electrons to flow from the **(-)** to the **(+)** positive location.
- Most atoms hold on tightly to their electrons, but some materials, the metals, have electrons in their outer orbitals that are less attached to the central nucleus.
- For example, copper (Cu) has 29 electrons, 2, 8, 8, 11 (10 + 1)
- These "free" electrons can hop between neighboring nuclei. They can move.
- We call these materials **conductors**.
- A common misconception is that the electron that hops into the conductor at one end is the same one that comes out the other. This is not the case. The conductor is filled with electrons and by pushing one in, we poop one out the other end. This is much, much faster.
