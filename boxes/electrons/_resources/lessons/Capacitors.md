# Electrons: Capacitors
Two conductors separated by an insulator (but in close proximity) can interact through the electric field. If we put an external voltage across these conductors, then they will gradually accumulate charge until their own voltage matches the external potential. We say that these devices have an intrinsic capacity for storing charge and we call them **capacitors**.

## Concepts
- What is capacitance?
- Adds time varying component to simple circuits
- RC time constant (10kOhms and 100uF) = 1 second (tau) (charge or discharge by ~63%)
- C in series (1/C), in parallel (C + C)
