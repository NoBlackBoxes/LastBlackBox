# Control : PWM
We can control a "continuous" range of outputs with a binary digital signal (only 0s and 1s) by switching the output **ON** and **OFF** very quickly. Our "continuous" output is then the average of the percentage of time spent **ON** vs **OFF**. We cal this percentage the "duty cycle", and we call this output control method *pulse width modulation* or **PWM**.

## Concepts
- What is the problem? (only digital outputs, but we want continuous control).
- We can flicker the binary output at a high frequency
- The duty cycle now determines are "average" output.
- Many microcontrollers have dedicated pins for generating PWM signals.
