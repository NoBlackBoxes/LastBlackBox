# Light : Electromagnetic Radiation
When an electric charge is accelerated something surprising happens. This acceleration creates a ripple in the electric field (which induces a magnetic field). This ripple propagates away from the accelerated charge at the speed of light. It is light.

## Concepts
- An electron at rest is surrounded by an electric field
- An electron in constant motion creates a magnetic field
- What happens to an electron that is accelerated?
- We must first acknowledge that electric fields don't change instantly (draw electric field)
- If this electron was previously somewhere else, then the force experienced by a nearby electron in the field, would have been different. It takes some time for the electric field to update.
- Let's draw this.
- The acceleration of the electron from it's old position to this new position creates a bend, a "kink" in the electric field.
- Let's look what is happening at that kink. We have a changing electric field, which will induce a changing magnetic field (draw it)...and that kink propagates away from the central location at some speed...the speed of light (c).
- This is light. A propagating EM pulse of energy.
- **Every time** an electron accelerates it radiates EM energy. Light.
- We often encounter (and now produce) oscillating electrons, moving back and forth at some rate.
- If we oscillate at a particular frequency, then we get a wave radiating with a wavelength determined by the speed of light.
- We are most familiar with wavelengths ranging from 700 to 400 nm. (420 to 750 Terrahertz - trillion times per second).
- But we can actually produce light a vast range of wavelengths (from way to less than a nanometer, something we call X-rays, to as large as kilometers)...simply by accelerating electrons at different frequencies.
- Let's "look" at some examples of how we can produce light.
- Here is light bulb, we  pass current through it and it glows. Why?
- Heat. We are heating up the atoms, they are crashing into one another and experiencing accelerations and decelerations. If those are violent enough, then the energy radiated enters the range our eyes are sensitive too.
- But all materials have a temperature and all of them radiate.
- We can use a thermal camera to see that even objects not as hot as the filament in a lightbulb, they will radiate light in the infrared range.
- Lastly, just to make a point. Our electronics also creates light. We will often be using voltages that change very quickly, causing electrons to accelerate...and this will generate light, albeit with much longer wavelengths than we can see. We call this radio waves.
- Let's try a quick demo. (Demo Arduino Radio)
- Now, this is a beautiful picture, static, motion, acceleration...light, but we call this the classical picture for a reason
- In the early 20th century, scientists and engineers were developing better and better light sensors, and they eventually got to the point where they could measure very, very small amounts of light...and they noticed something strange
- If we look at our wiggling electron, we would expect as we move the sensor around, we would detect a pulse of energy, with some delay after the wiggle, from anywhere around the electron. It would get weaker as we move further away and stronger nearby.
- But that isn;t what they found
- Instead, they would occasionally get one big pulse, and mostly nothing
- All of the energy of the wiggle appeared to be delivered in one discrete packet, one quanta. We call this a photon.
- Normally, we are wiggling so many electrons, that our classical wave description of light is perfectly adequate, but the quantum mechanical picture is "more true".
