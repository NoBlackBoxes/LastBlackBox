# Light : Radio

Let's build some radios.

- Crystal/diode (un-powered)

- Transistor

- Amp (AM)

- Super-het

## LC Tanks

- Easy to measure with an oscilloscope. Send a square wave through a small inductor (from Arduino?) and place nearby the LC circuit. Measure voltage "induced" across the cap.
