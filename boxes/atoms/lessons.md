## [Atomic Structure](https://vimeo.com/1000458082)
> A brief introduction to the physics of atoms, their parts (protons, neutrons, and electrons), and their classical vs. quantum structure.

## [Orbitals](https://vimeo.com/??????)
> Only a specific number of electrons can *fit* into each level (orbit) around the Nucleus. 2 can fit nearby. 8 can fit in the next ring. 18 in the next. Those closest to the Nucleus are the most strongly attached. Also, any atoms with in *incomplete* ring are "unhappy"...they'd prefer to have a full set.

## [Chemistry](https://vimeo.com/??????)
> Atoms with incomplete outer (valence) orbitals will try to complete their set of electrons by sharing, donating, or stealing electrons from other Atoms. This is called chemistry.

## [The Periodic Table](https://vimeo.com/1000458082)
> The organization of elements into a table reveals a regular pattern, which is linked to the fundamental chemical properties of each material.
- When you need it *(and you will)*, then you can find a copy of the periodic table [here](_data/images/periodic_table.png).
+ The electron configuration (assignments to specific orbitals) of each atomic element can be viewed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configurations_of_the_elements_(data_page)).

## [Nuclear Forces](https://vimeo.com/??????)
> Wait. What's up with Hydrogen? Why no Neutrons? Oh...what about Helium? Why don't those Protons, with their positve charges, just fly apart?

## [Fission and Fusion](https://vimeo.com/??????)
> Not all Nuclei are stable, sometimes they can fall apart (fission). What if two atoms goet*sooooo* close to one another that their Nuclei connect (fuse)? Lots of energy.
