# Atoms

## Atomic Structure
Video=https://vimeo.com/1000458082
> A brief introduction to the physics of atoms, their parts (protons, neutrons, and electrons), and their classical vs. quantum structure.

## Orbitals
Video=https://vimeo.com/??????
> Only a specific number of electrons can *fit* at each level (orbit) around the Nucleus. 2 can fit nearby. 8 can fit in the next ring. 18 in the next. Those closest to the Nucleus are the most strongly attached. Also, any atoms with in *incomplete* ring are "unhappy"...they'd prefer to have a full load.

## Chemistry
Video=https://vimeo.com/??????
> Atoms with incomplete outer (valence) orbitals will try to complete their set of electrons by sharing, donating, or stealing electrons from other Atoms. This is called chemistry.

## The Periodic Table
Video=https://vimeo.com/1000458082
> The organization of elements into a table reveals a regular pattern, which is linked to the fundamental chemical properties of each material.
- *Help*:{01}:When you need it *(and you will)*, then you can find a copy of the periodic table [here](_data/images/periodic_table.png).
- *Note*:{01}:The electron configuration (assignments to specific orbitals) of each atomic element can be viewed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configurations_of_the_elements_(data_page)).

## Nuclear Forces
Video=https://vimeo.com/??????
> Wait. What's up with Hydrogen? Why no Neutrons? Oh...what about Helium? Why don't those Protons, with their positve charges, just fly apart?

## Fission and Fusion
Video=https://vimeo.com/??????
> Not all Nuclei are stable, sometimes they can fall apart (fission). What if two atoms go *sooooo* close to one another that their Nuclei connected (fused)? Lots of energy.
