# Atoms: Orbitals
Only a specific number of electrons can *fit* into each level (orbit) around the Nucleus. 2 can fit nearby. 8 can fit in the next ring. 18 in the next. Those closest to the Nucleus are the most strongly attached. Also, any atoms with in *incomplete* ring are "unhappy"...they'd prefer to have a full set.
