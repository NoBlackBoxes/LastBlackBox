# Atoms : Heat
Atoms in every material are always moving. This motion of atoms (their average kinetic energy) is heat.

## Concepts
- The motion of atoms (their average kinetic energy) is heat.
- (Movement causes collisions, which causes the acceleration of electrons, which creates light, which we can sometimes visualize with a thermal camera).
- If we do something to make atoms move faster, then the material will "warm up".
- If we cool the material as much as possible, to absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius), then the atoms will stop moving.
