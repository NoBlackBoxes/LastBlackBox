## Concepts
- The average motion of atoms (their average kinetic energy) is heat.
- (Accelerating electrons creates light, which we can sometimes visualize with a thermal camera).
- If we do something to make them move faster, then they will warm up.
- If we cool them as much as possible, to absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius), then they will stop.
