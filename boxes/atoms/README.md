## The Atom

Atom's matter. They *are* matter.

  - **Task**(draw_carbon): Carbon is pretty important atom for us (and all living things that we know of). Draw a Carbon atom (C12, 6 protons and 6 neutrons) using the "old-school" Bohr style. Upload a photo of your Carbon drawing here [photo].

## Charge

Electrons are negative. Protons are postive. Like repels like. Opposites attract.

## Orbitals

Only a specific number of electrons can *fit* at each level (orbit) around the Nucleus. 2 can fit nearby. 8 can fit in the next ring. 18 in the next. Those closest to the Nucleus are the most strongly attached. Also, any atoms with in *incomplete* ring are "unhappy"...they'd prefer to have a full load.

## Chemistry

Atoms with incomplete outer (valence) orbitals will try to complete their set of electrons by sharing, donating, or stealing electrons from other Atoms. This is called chemistry.

## Nuclear Forces

Wait. What's up with Hydrogen? Why no Neutrons? Oh...what about Helium? Why don't those Protons, with their positve charges, just fly apart?

## Fission and Fusion

Not all Nuclei are stable, sometimes they can fall apart (fission). What if two atoms go *sooooo* close to one another that their Nuclei connected (fused)? Lots of energy.
