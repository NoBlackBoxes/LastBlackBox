# Atoms : The Periodic Table
Organizing the elements into a table reveals a regular pattern, which is linked to the fundamental chemical properties of each material.

## Concepts
-Review orbitals of atoms
- Orbitals have different capacities
    - Row/Period 1: 1s (2): Hydrogen and Helium
    - Row/Period 2: 8 (2s + 2p, 2 + 6 = 8)
    - Row/Period 3: 8 - Na + Cl (also metals)
    - Row/Period 4: 8 + 10 = 18 - Metals!
- Filling Order: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p
- Chemical properties determined by column
- Material properties also apparent in table position (metals = shiny = free electrons)
- Unstable/radioactive Nuclei are the larger ones

## Connections
- Iron is (by Mass) the most common element on Earth
- Iron is the last element produced in a star

## Lesson
- When you need it *(and you will)*, then you can find a copy of the periodic table [here](/boxes/atoms/_resources/images/periodic_table.png).
+ The electron configuration (assignments to specific orbitals) of each atomic element can be viewed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configurations_of_the_elements_(data_page)).
