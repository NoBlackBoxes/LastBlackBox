# Atoms : Atomic Structure
A brief introduction to the physics of atoms, their parts (protons, neutrons, and electrons), and their classical vs. quantum structure.

## [Video](https://vimeo.com/1000458082)

## Concepts
- Everything is made of Atoms
- Parts: Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons
- Classical vs Quantum view of orbitals
- Electric Charge and electric forces (attraction and repulsion)
- The number of protons determines the type of element, what element is this? Helium
- Orbits (orbitals) have limited capacity, 2, 8, etc.
- Let's look at a very useful atom for us, Oxygen (8 = 2 + 6)
- The outermost electrons of an atom determines how it interacts with other atoms (chemistry)
- Valence Electrons (covalent bonds)
- Water
- Chemistry

## Connections
- Why don't protons in the nucleus fly apart? They are both positively charged?
- Happy Atoms (Noble Gases)

## Lesson
+ **TASK**: Draw your favorite atom in the "classical" style
> You should have the appropriate number of electrons in each orbital.
