# Audio : NB3_mouth

PCB design and fabrication for NB3 mouth, a mono i2s DAC and Amplifier

## Parts

- MAX98357A from Maxim: [datasheet](libraries/parts/I2S_DAC-AMP_MAX98357A/I2S_DAC-AMP_MAX98357A.pdf)

## Fabrication

### Generate files
0. Save front/back renders and 3D model (step)
1. Create "fab" folder in KiCAD project root
2. Export BOM (as CSV): File->Fabrication outputs->BOM
3. Edit BOM: Open as ODS and save as XLSX in "fab" folder
4. Generate Gerbers: File->Fabrication outputs->Gerbers [settings](NB3_mouth_FAB_plot_settings.png)
5. Generate Drill: File->Fabrication outputs->Drill Files [settings](NB3_mouth_FAB_drill_settings.png)
6. Generate Centroids: File->Fabrication outputs->Componenet Placement [settings](NB3_mouth_FAB_pos_settings.png)
7. Zip entire fab folder (including BOM.xlsx)
