# Audio : Microphones, Speakers, and I2S
Here we introduce the NB3's audio system: MEMs-based stereo microphones (Ears), a Class D digital amplifier connected to a "Hi-Fi" speaker (Mouth), and a sound communication standard called I2S (Inter-integrated Circuit Sound) that the Raspberry Pi will use to talk to these audio devices.

## Concepts
- MEMs mics and beyond.
- Better sounding speakers. How?
- I2S is a fully-digital protocol used by modern CPUs to talk to audio devices over a small number of connections. It requires only a clock, LR select (for selecting which channel is being written/read), data in (for microphone input), and data out (for speaker output).
