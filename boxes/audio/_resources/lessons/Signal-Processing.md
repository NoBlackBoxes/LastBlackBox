# Audio : Signal Processing
One-dimensional (1D) signals are common in the world. They often arise as time series (a sequence of measurements made at a regular "sample rate"). Here we will explore techniques to process a common 1D signal...**sound**. We will measure a sound's amplitude (volume), frequency content, and visualize the "spectrogram" of different spoken words (e.g. "Go" vs "Stop").

- Record and plot a sound waveform
- Measure volume
  - Explore inter-ear (aural) level difference (ILD)
- Measure frequency (FFT)
- Measure spectrogram
  - Visually distinguish Go vs Stop (?)
