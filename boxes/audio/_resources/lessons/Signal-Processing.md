# Audio : Signal Processing
One-dimensional (1D) signals are common in the world. They often arise as time series (a sequence of measurements made a regular "sample rate"). Here we will explore techniques to process one of these 1D signals...**sound**. We will measure sound amplitude (volume), timing of sound arrival at two different microphones (ears), and the frequency content of different sound types.
