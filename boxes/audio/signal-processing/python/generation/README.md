# Audio : Signal Processing : Python : Generation
Here we learn about sound by generating audio signals in code, listening to them, and visualizing their spectra/spectrograms.

## Requirements
To generate "speech" using a Text-to-Speech engine (TTS), then you must install a classic Linux library called "espeak".

```bash
sudo apt install espeak-ng
```
