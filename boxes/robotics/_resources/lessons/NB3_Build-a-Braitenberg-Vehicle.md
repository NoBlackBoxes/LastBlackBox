# Robotics : NB3 : Build a Braitenberg Vehicle
Here we create the first Braitenberg Vehicle, a simple sensory-motor feedback loop connecting two light sensors to the motion of two wheels.

- **TASK**: Measure two light sensors and *decide* how to activate the direction of your two wheels in response.
> You should have created a robot that wither likes (turns toward) or avoids (turns away from) light.
