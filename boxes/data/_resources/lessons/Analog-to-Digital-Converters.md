# Data : Analog to Digital Converters
Moving signals from the analog world to the digital world requires converting a continuous voltage into discrete binary values. We can accomplish this with an analog to digital converter, or **ADC**, and here we learn how they work.

## Concepts
- Resistor ladder to produce discrete voltage values.
- Comparators to determine the max level.
- A priority encoder to produce a binary value.
- This is called a Flash ADC.

## Lesson

- Build the input stage for a 2-bit ADC using the LM339/LM2901 comparator and a resistor ladder.
