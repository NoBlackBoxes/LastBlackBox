# Computers : NB3 : Building a Theremin
Building a light-to-sound feedback loop musical instrument (theremin) using an Arduino, an LDR, and a Piezo buzzer.

## [Video](https://vimeo.com/1033896646)

## Concepts
- Build the output (piezo buzzer)
- Test the output
- Build the input (LDR light sensor)
- Test the input (analog serial read)
- Combine!

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Build a Theremin
- *Hint*: What if you used the analog voltage signal measured from your light sensor to change the frequency of the "tone" playing on your buzzer? Hmm...
> You should here a sound that varies with your hand motion (in front of a light)

- **TASK**: ***Have fun!*** (Make something cool)
- This diagram of the Arduino "pins" will definitely be useful: ![Arduino Pinout](/boxes/computers/_resources/images/pinout_arduino_nano.png)
> You should have fun!
