# Computers : NB3 : Hindbrain
We will now add a *computer* to our robot. We be using a simple microcontroller as our NB3's hindbrain. It will be responsible for controlling the "muscles" (motors) in response to commands from another (larger) computer that we will be adding later to the NB3's midbrain.
