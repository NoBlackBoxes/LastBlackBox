# Computers: NB3: Hindbrain
We will now add a *computer* to our robot. We will begin by adding a simple microcontroller as our NB3's hindbrain. It will be responsible for controlling the "muscles" (motors) in response to commands from another (larger) computer that we will add later to the NB3 midbrain.
