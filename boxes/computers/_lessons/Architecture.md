# Computers: Architecture
The basic building blocks of a computer (memory, ALU, clock, bus, and IO) have a standard arrangement (architecture) in modern systems.

## [Video](https://vimeo.com/1033601146)

## Concepts
- Building blocks for abstraction
- Logic gates to operations to ALU
- Memory cells to Registers and RAM
- Clock for synchronizing ops
- Multiplexers (select OP result)
- Bus to tie it all together
- From abstraction to implementation (Die image of Atmel Mega 328P)
- To Fix:
  - Explain Flash as long term (uses floating gates)
  - Explain RAM as SRAM and Registers (uses latches)
  - Explain DRAM (another video?)
  - Explain IO
  - Interrupts?
  - Better drawings...or cut models...
