# Computers: Architecture
The basic building blocks of a computer (memory, ALU, clock, bus, and IO) have a standard arrangement (architecture) in modern systems.

## [Video]()

## Concepts
- Building blocks for abstraction
- Logic gates to operations to ALU
- Memory cells to Registers and RAM
- Clock for synchronizing ops
- Multiplexers (select OP result)
- Bus to tie it all together
- From abstraction to implementation (Die image of Atmel Mega 328P)
