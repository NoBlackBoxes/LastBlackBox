# Linux : Navigating the Command Line
The original user interfaces were entirely based on text. You typed commands as a line of text into your terminal console and received the result as a string of characters on the screen. Navigating this **command line** remains a useful skill, and a necessary one when working with remote machines.

## Concepts
- Where are you? (pwd)
- What is there? ls (ls -la)
- moving around (cd) (tab completion) and the ".." syntax, going home (~), going to root "/"
- creating folders (mkdir)
- creating and editing text files (nano)
- copying/moving/deleting files and folders ("cp, mv, rm")
- viewing text files (less)
- getting help?
- extra privileges ("sudo")
- what is running? 

## Lesson

- **TASK**: Explore Linux. Spend any extra time you have fiddling, playing with the UNIX approach to controlling a computer. Create some folders. Edit some files.
> You should see this in the command line.
